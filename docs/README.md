# Java Primer Information

This initiative is an arrangement with our client, Cognizant, and everyone chosen to participate is guaranteed an interview with them after completion of the program. Your marketing will continue as it has been, meaning you will take interviews with other clients as scheduled. If not selected by the time the program is complete, you will have the Cognizant interview very shortly after.

- Structure: 
    - You will complete a full-stack Java application following the attached requirements. Note: You may design your front end with the framework used during your bootcamp instead of plain JS if desired.
You will also complete studies on the attached theoretical materials (a PDF and some PowerPoints). These are all concepts you should be familiar with. There will be assessments on this content.
There is also a question bank for studying, and here is a GitHub repo you may use for coding examples and explanations:  https://github.com/revaturelabs/java-primer

- Timeline: 
    - Project demos on 2/27 and 2/28. 
A traditional QC will be either late this week or early next week. 
Other assessments will be conducted throughout this week and next, and you should be prepared to speak concretely on your progress in your daily stand-ups. You will be asked to show code or demo your progress prior to the official demo. 
Interviews will begin the following Monday,  3/2.
